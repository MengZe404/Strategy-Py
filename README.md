# Strategy-Py

Welcome to Strategy-Py, a simple and fun Real Time Strategy (RTS) game made in Python!

## Background Story: 

People, Society, Culture, Education, Economics...
The world is having a difficult time due to the rapid war.

You, as the king of your kingdom, will bring peace to your people.
Use your power and resources to eliminate the other kingdoms and dominate this unpeaceful land!

## Kingdoms:

Devs Empire (you)
Nusta Kingdom (opponent no.1)
Lozar Kingdom (opponent no.2)

## Game Play:

This is a Turn-Based RTS game.
Use commands (to check all available commands, type ? or help) to control your character and take actions for each round.

Be careful when making the decisions because each action can cause the resources to increase/decrease and trigger special events!

At a special round, you will find the other kingdom and you can choose to take-over (when you have the enough resources)
